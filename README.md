# custom_profile

Drupal custom profile with make file

Copy of the standard profile from drupal core and changed all file name and function name from standard to custom_profile. I have also modified .info file removing overlay on installation and added few more modules to be installed on site installation.

List of modules enabled on installation a part from the standard: admin_menu, backup_migrate, ctools, diff, features, features_diff, strongarm, fe_block, views, views_ui, devel, context, context_ui, date_api, date, date_views, libraries, module_filter, entity, token, pathauto.
